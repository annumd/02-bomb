# bomb

This project is a simple and fun web-based game where a bomb emoji (ðŸ’£) moves to random positions when clicked. The heading and instructions are centered, and the bomb never overlaps them. The page has a responsive design to ensure proper alignment and functionality across devices like phones, tablets, and laptops.

Features

1. Interactive Bomb: Clicking on the bomb triggers an explosion animation (ðŸ’¥) and moves the bomb to a random position on the screen.
2. Centered Heading and Description: A clear title, "BOMB," and instructions, "(click on the bomb)," are displayed in the center of the screen.
3. Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring consistent appearance and functionality.
4. Boundary Protection: The bomb stays within the visible screen area and avoids overlapping with the heading or description.

Technologies Used

1. HTML5: For structuring the page.
2. CSS3: For styling the background, text, and animations.
3. JavaScript: For handling the bomb's movement and interactions.

Future Enhancements

Add sound effects for the explosion.
Introduce a scoring mechanism to count clicks within a time limit.
Include difficulty levels where the bomb moves faster.
